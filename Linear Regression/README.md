# Simple Linear Regression

This repository contains code for building a simple linear regression model to predict salary based on years of experience. The dataset used for training and testing is the `Salary_Data.csv` dataset.

## Overview

The simple linear regression model is trained on the provided dataset to predict salary based on years of experience. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared value to assess its accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset contains two columns: years of experience and corresponding salary.

## Files

- `Salary_Data.csv`: Dataset file containing years of experience and salary data.
- `simple_linear_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training, testing, and evaluating the simple linear regression model.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Instructions

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the files.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `simple_linear_regression.ipynb` in an environment such as Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
4. Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to train the simple linear regression model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance.
5. Ensure that the dataset file `Salary_Data.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook or provide the correct path to the dataset.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared value to assess its accuracy in predicting salaries based on years of experience.
