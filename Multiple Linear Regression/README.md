# Multiple Linear Regression Model

This repository contains code for building a multiple linear regression model to predict profits of startups based on various factors such as R&D spend, administration spend, marketing spend, and location. The dataset used for training and testing is the `50_Startups.csv` dataset.

## Overview

The multiple linear regression model achieves a satisfactory performance in predicting the profits of startups. By analyzing the relationships between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (profit), the model can provide insights into how different factors contribute to the profitability of startups.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about different startups, including R&D spend, administration spend, marketing spend, and location. The target variable is the profit generated by each startup.

## Files

- `50_Startups.csv`: Dataset file containing startup information and profit values.
- `multiple_linear_regression.py`: Python script containing the code for training, testing, and evaluating the multiple linear regression model.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Instructions

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the files.
3. Open the Python script `multiple_linear_regression.py` in a Python environment such as Jupyter Notebook or a text editor.
4. Execute the script to train the multiple linear regression model, make predictions, and visualize the results.
5. Ensure that the dataset file `50_Startups.csv` is in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the dataset.

## Evaluation

The performance of the multiple linear regression model can be evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), R-squared value, and others to assess its accuracy in predicting profits.
