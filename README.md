# Simple Linear Regression Model

This Python script implements a Simple Linear Regression model to predict salaries based on years of experience.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
git clone <repository_URL>
cd <repository_name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your dataset in CSV format named `Salary_Data.csv` in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python simple_linear_regression.py
```

## Results

The script generates visualizations representing the relationship between years of experience and salary, both for the training and test datasets.

- `Salary vs Experience (Training set)`: Visualizes the training set data points and the fitted regression line.
- `Salary vs Experience (Test set)`: Visualizes the test set data points and the fitted regression line.

## File Structure

- `simple_linear_regression.py`: Main Python script implementing the Simple Linear Regression model.
- `Salary_Data.csv`: Dataset containing years of experience and corresponding salaries.
