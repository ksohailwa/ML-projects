# Multiple Linear Regression Model

This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict profits of startups based on various factors such as R&D spend, administration spend, marketing spend, and location.

## Overview

The repository contains Python code that demonstrates how to perform Multiple Linear Regression using the `sklearn` library. It includes importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training the model, making predictions, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `50_Startups.csv`, which contains information about different startups including R&D spend, administration spend, marketing spend, and location.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository_URL>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd <repository_name>
```

3. Run the Python script `multiple_linear_regression.py`:

```
python multiple_linear_regression.py
```

## File Structure

- `multiple_linear_regression.py`: Main Python script implementing the Multiple Linear Regression model.
- `50_Startups.csv`: Dataset containing information about startups.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Results

The script trains the Multiple Linear Regression model on the training set and evaluates its performance on the test set. It prints the predicted profits alongside the actual profits for comparison.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn

Make sure to install the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```
